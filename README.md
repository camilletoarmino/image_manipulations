# Data Generation
These scripts manipulate images to impose synthetic handwriting data on different kinds of backgrounds. 

# Artificial Lines
Using artificial lines in the synthetic data generation allows for a great deal of control over various aspects
of the backgrounds. For example, line spacing, line thickness, line color, and line angle can all be controlled
to generate many different kinds of backgrounds. One downside to this approach is that the generated lines
do not have the same kind of noisiness that true lines have. Lines in real backgrounds do not usually have
just one pixel value, and the edges of the lines are not perfectly straight.
